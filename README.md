# End-to-End Encrypted File Storage (Mid Evaluation)

Through this project I aim to build a secure web-based file storage and sharing platform using end-to-end encryption(web crypto API).
All files are intended to be encrypted on the client side before being uploaded and the client will not depend upon the server for the encryption. The encryption will be end to end as only the client and the receiver will have the access to the encryption keys, noone in between can interfere and access the data.

# Current Status
- Project repository created
- Basic project structure created
- Frontend files set up (HTML and JavaScript)
- Learning and exploring Web Crypto API for client-side encryption
- Client-side encryption implemented using JavaScript
- Learned basics of Web Crypto API and AES-GCM

# Technologies Planned
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Web Crypto API
- Node.js and Express (will be used in later phase)

# Next Steps
- Implement file decryption for encrypted (.enc) files
- Make the interface better by using CSS
- Improve user experience by automating encryption on file selection (by removing the press button for encrypting the file)
- Explore secure key storage and key-sharing mechanisms
- Work on a backend to store encrypted files
- Add user authentication and access control
