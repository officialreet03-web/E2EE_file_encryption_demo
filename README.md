# End-to-End Encrypted File Storage (Mid Evaluation)

This project aims to build a secure web-based file storage and sharing platform using end-to-end encryption.
All files are intended to be encrypted on the client side before being uploaded, so the server never sees the original data.

## Current Status
- Project repository initialized
- Basic project structure created
- Frontend files set up (HTML and JavaScript)
- Learning and exploring Web Crypto API for client-side encryption

## Technologies Planned
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Web Crypto API
- Node.js and Express (later phase)

## Next Steps
- Implement client-side file encryption using AES-GCM
- Add file upload and encryption logic
- Test encryption workflow in the browser
